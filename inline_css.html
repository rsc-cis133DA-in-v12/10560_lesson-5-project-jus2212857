        <h2 style="color:purple">Differences Between the Generic Font Families</h2>
        <p style="font-weight:lighter Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">There are five different types of generic font families: serif, sans-serif, cursive, fantasy, and monospace. Serif font has little flags at the tips or ends of the letters. Sans-serif does not. Cursive fonts try to look like cursive writing or handwritten letters. Fantasy font uses decorative representations of characters. These types of fonts use proportional fonts, which means if the letter is wide, it takes up more space. The final type is monospace, which is the opposite of proportional, which means each letter takes up the same space, whether it is bigger or smaller.</p>
        <h2 style="color: rgb(173,216,230)">Different Ways To Add Color To A Web Page or In Text</h2>
        <p style="font-size:16px serif courier, menlo, lucida, serif">There are three different ways to add color to a web page or in text: RGB color, hexadecimal color, and color names. RGB color uses red, green, and blue to make a color. You would use numbers to specify color saturation or intensity. Hexadecimal color uses codes that may include letters, numbers, or a combination of the two. The letters go from A to F, and the numbers go from 0 to 9. You would use a # symbol in this case. Color names are simply that, the names of the colors, like blue, lightblue, red, orange, etc.</p>
